All the animals in the jungle just want to dance, but a party can’t survive on sweet dance moves alone. It’s up to you to keep the party-goers drinking, fed, and happy, so they can keep on dancing.

Party Animals is a town building simulation game with Role-Playing Game elements. It takes place on the edge of the dank forest, where you can build and upgrade your very own town. Ravelings are wild animals who just want to party, and can’t wait for the sun to set so they can show off their dance moves. If a raveling likes what you’ve built they might stick around and help you evolve your town after the sun rises and the party dies down.

All ravelings have needs and will act on their own to satisfy them, you can’t actually directly control your ravelings. Still, if you ask nicely Ravelings who have an affinity towards nesting might help grow your town.

But it’s not all fun and games. Ravelings are fickle, and it’s up to you to keep them entertained so they’ll stick around. Also, some ravelings out in the forest have been infected, and if they show up to crash your party it could cause chaos. This will give your ravelings a chance to show off their dance moves, and if they win a dance-off the infected ravelings will leave with shame and embarrassment.

Party Animals won’t be released anytime soon, but it growing and evolving every day. Keep an eye out for future posts offering either technical deep dives into individual systems or high-level explanations of features and gameplay!
